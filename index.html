                    I came into this project only knowing some Android development. I started with questions
                    like: Where was
                    I going to store the data? How was I going to rank the players?
                    How would the players view their rankings? How do you make a webapp? How do you find a server? How a
                    server
                    works? Which server would be best for this project? How would I transmit the data between app to
                    server to webapp? And many more.
                    My plan started with making a simple app. This app would be designed to input all the data gathered
                    from the
                    tests, process that
                    data through the necessary algorithms for rankings, and then upload the data to my
                    server. This app was made only for me to input data, the user would never see this app. The server
                    would be where I keep all the data. I chose Firebase for this particular
                    application. I learned how firebase worked and
                    designed a storage system around it's Document and collection system to suit my needs and ensure it
                    would have connectivity between my Android app and webapp. From there I learned how to make a webapp
                    using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and how to test it using Node.js. With this plan I set out to complete
                    the application.

                          <li>
                            <b>Forever young!</b> When creating new users I should ask for birth date, not age. That way
                            I can calculate age. So when I organize my rankings by age, they're accurate.
                          </li>
                          <li>
                            <b>Nobody's perfect!</b> Ask for confirmation screens after submitting that displays the
                            information you want to submit, ensuring that incorrect data isn't uploaded to the server.
                          </li>
                          <li>
                            <b>Over the Hump!</b> Implement an a "good" idea and improve upon it. Instead of spending to
                            much
                            time searching for the "best" idea to accomplish a task.
                          </li>
                          <li>
                            <b>One at a time!</b> How would I account for multiple people trying to input data at the
                            same time. In my case there is only one app, but if I were to scale it up how would I manage
                            two apps adjusting data at the same time? This is something I'd like to think about for
                            future projects.
                          </li>
                          <li>
                            <b>To much on my plate!</b> I only use two activities to accomplish multiple tasks for
                            players
                            and standards. It would more intuitive to have a separate activity for each task rather than
                            trying to tackle multiple functionality in each activity.

                    I became more familiar with web design and learned how to run PHP through the server. As well as how

                    to load files to a hosting service like GoDaddy. I also used git with this project, which gained me

                        speed up as you score more and more points, making the game harder as time passes. Once you fail

                  <p class="grey-text">I learned about the Android activity lifecycle. How to send information from
                    activity
                    to activity. The game itself was programmed in Java. I modularized the code properly so new
                    features can be added in easily. The menu was made to encompass different modes. The game objects
                    are made so that the blocks can be more or less than three-sided when creating different modes. I
                    learned how to code a physics engine and made sure that frame rate matched
                    the capacity of the processor that was running the game. </p>

                  <p class="grey-text">Test more with people during the development process to understand whether or not
                    people will have fun playing the game and ask for feedback. This wasn't a priority in this project
                    due to the focus of this project being to learn. I'd love to try and learn how to implement my own
                    graphics. I modularized the code well, but I know I can go broader, so next time I will try to
                    encompass even more into the design before starting the project. For example, I had to go back and
                    adjust some of my objects so I can add bonuses and new game features. </p>

                        and the
                        UI that was provided by the class. After understanding the basics I designed a data structure
                        that I could use with the UI. I had to make sure that it was compatible. Beyond that I didn't
                        plan much more. This was my first CS project, so I learned a lot of what not to do during the
                        design phase.

                        significantly hinder
                        progress.</p>

                        Before I start I would understand all features that I would like my data structure to accomplish
                        and include that in my system design phase. Having to go back and constantly add functionality
                        in my data structure was very inefficient. Another problem I had was all of my code was
                        completed on one page. Next time, I would make sure that I modularize all of my code to make
                        debugging and understanding the code easier.

                    This story starts in high school around the time where everyone has to choose a career. I had no
                    idea what I wanted to do. So I found an online Career quiz and decided to take it. The kind of quiz
                    that tells you which career you should pursue. The quiz
                    chose Software Engineer for me. At the time I didn't want to trust the quiz, so I asked a teacher, someone I
                    thought of as a mentor. He told me that I should be a Mechanical Engineer. Believing that my teacher
                    would know me more than a 10 minute quiz could, I decided that I would go with Mechanical Engineering. But now looking
                    back I'm sure I should've chosen Software Engineer. I realized this when I took software classes for
                    the first time in college and fell in love with coding. So much so I even took my data structure course on top of my
                    senior level classes. At the time it was to late to switch but I'm now looking back to get
                    into software field.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I don't regret majoring in Mechanical Engineering at all. In fact, I'm glad things turned out this
                    way. Being able to design Hardware has proven to be a valuable skill in my personal projects as well
                    as for my contract work. In the future I hope to be able to work on more difficult
                    projects involving both software and hardware. I've gotten plenty of experience working as a
                    Mechanical engineer as part of a company at Aether and by completing contract work, now I'm looking to do the same with
                    Software Engineering.
